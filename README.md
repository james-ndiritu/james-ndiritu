## Backend Developer | AI & Machine Learning Enthusiast

I am a software developer with a strong focus on backend systems, API development, and AI integrations.  
While I have solid experience in building full-stack applications using modern frontend tools, my primary goal is to specialize in backend engineering and intelligent systems powered by machine learning.
